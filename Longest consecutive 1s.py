#The idea is based on the concept that if we AND a bit sequence with a shifted version of itself,
#weâ€™re effectively removing the trailing 1 from every sequence of consecutive 1s.

#    & 11011110   (x << 1)
#    ----------
#      11001110   (x & (x << 1))
#        ^    ^
#        |    |
 #  trailing 1 removed
#So the operation x = (x & (x << 1)) reduces length of every sequence of 1s by one in binary representation of x.
#If we keep doing this operation in a loop, we end up with x = 0. The number of iterations required to reach 0 is actually
#length of the longest consecutive sequence of 1s.
